# Predicting_NYC_School_Bus_Breakdowns_Capstone_Project (Team B)
This capstone project analyzes a large dataset extracted from the Department of Education as part of the requirements for DATA 606 at the University of Baltimore County (UMBC). The dataset is called Bus Breakdown and Delays. The Bus Breakdown and Delay system collects information from school bus vendors operating out in the field in real time. Bus staff that encounter delays during the route are instructed to radio the dispatcher at the bus vendor’s central office. The bus vendor staff are then instructed to log into the Bus Breakdown and Delay system to record the event and notify OPT. OPT customer service agents use this system to inform parents who call with questions regarding bus service. The Bus Breakdown and Delay system is publicly accessible and contains real time updates. All information in the system is entered by school bus vendor staff.

This project tackled the challenge of predicting school bus incidents by leveraging a comprehensive dataset from the NYC Open Data portal. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning (ML), and interactive visualization tools, we identified key operational factors driving delays and breakdowns and developed predictive models for future incidents based on route, contractor, and historical patterns. EDA uncovered significant temporal trends, borough-specific patterns, and primary delay reasons, guiding feature selection for ML models. Thereby, the XGBoost classification model accurately predicted incident types, achieving 99% accuracy for delays and 73% for breakdowns, with corresponding F1-scores of 99% and 77%. The most influential feature was the reason for the incident, with "Won’t Start" being the top cause of breakdowns and "Heavy Traffic" for delays. The Random Forest Regressor model estimated delay durations with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 9.6 minutes and an R² score of 82%, identifying “Bus Company Name” as the most significant predictor of delay duration. Deliverables for this project include a Power BI dashboard visualizing delay density, temporal trends, and key performance indicators, and a Streamlit web app enabling real-time predictions of incident type and delay duration. These tools empower school transportation officials to identify high-risk routes, optimize resource allocation, and enhance strategic planning. Through harnessing data-driven insights, this project enables NYC’s Department of Education to improve school bus operation reliability and efficiency, benefiting students and stakeholders.
